Principles of design infographic

This infographic was created to explain and provide examples of key design principles in my own words. The infographic included boxed information with graphic examples of each principle upon hovering over a section.

Although rather simplistic in skill only using HTML and CSS for styling, each design principle was written in my own words and required me to think critically about how these principles affect web development.

Regardless of the simplicity, this infographic was perfect for practicing flexbox and learning more about effective design.
