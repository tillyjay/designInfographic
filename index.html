        <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <p>It is essential to establish contrast between distinct elements
            on a webpage, whether it is colour, size, or form, so that each
            element can uniquely stand out from the rest. Contrast not only
            helps the user distinguish between elements, but also improves 
            page readability and navigation.</p>

        <div class="hoverImgR">
        <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <p>Well used repetition can provide a webpage with consistency and flow. 
               Repeated use of elements with a common property creates a 
               satisfying visual pattern and a sense of comfort. Although, 
               it is important to provide variation with little adjustments, 
               in order to pique the user’s inquisitiveness and avoid a webpage 
               becoming monotone.</p>

    <div class="principle" id="alignment">
        <div class="hoverImgA">
        <h2>Alignment</h2>
            <p>Proper alignment helps to provide structure, and can be the difference 
               between a professional, or an amateur hour webpage. A user may 
               not always notice alignment is present in good web design, but they
               will certainly notice when it is not. Used effectively, alignment can 
               create a compelling blueprint for the user’s eye to travel, and significantly 
               impact the overall aesthetic of the design.</p>

    <div class="principle" id="proximity">
        <div class="hoverImgP">
        <h2>Proximity</h2>
            <p>At face value, effective use of proximity is required to reduce the look of clutter, 
               and through the strategic use of white space to produce a comprehensive and
               professional webpage. Equally as important, proximity is used to establish harmonious 
               relationships between distinct elements, or to isolate them, by creating meaningful 
               groupings that convey significance to the user.</p>
